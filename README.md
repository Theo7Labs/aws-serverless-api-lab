# AWS Serverless API Project (Lab Walkthrough)

This project was completed using AWS Skill Builder. It demonstrates how to deploy a serverless API using Lambda, API Gateway, and S3 ‚Äî all defined using AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model). Everything was tested and verified through real scenarios in Cloud9.

---

## üîß Technologies Used

- AWS Lambda (Python 3.9)
- Amazon API Gateway (HTTP API)
- Amazon S3
- AWS SAM CLI
- Cloud9 IDE
- IAM Roles

---

## ‚úÖ What This Project Does

- Deploys an API endpoint using AWS SAM
- Connects Lambda to read from S3 (`object1`)
- Returns the object content to a browser or curl request

---

## üß™ How to Test the API

1. Deploy using:

```bash
sam build
sam deploy --guided
curl https://your-api.amazonaws.com/labfunction
{"result": "Welcome to AWS Lambda!"}
